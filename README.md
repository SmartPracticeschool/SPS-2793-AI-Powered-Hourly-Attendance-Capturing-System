AI-Powered Hourly Attendance Capturing System
Maintaining attendance is very important in all the institutes for checking the attendance percentage of Students.
Every institute has its own method in this regard.
Some are taking attendance manually on the register for every hour and later
they will upload every hour data of a class to the server or file-based approach and some have adopted methods of automatic attendance using some biometric techniques.
But these methods are inefficient and time-consuming, AI can definitely find a solution to this problem.
